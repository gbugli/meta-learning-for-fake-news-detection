# This script is a utility script to help start singularity instance with the expected binds and overlays.
# It is intended to be used in conjuction with the `scripts/create_base_overlay.sh` and `scripts/create_package_overlay.sh`
# scripts which create the required overlays.

# The behavior of this script may be configured to manage where the dataset overlay is loaded from
# and where the temporary overlay is placed.

# Inside the container, we mount the standard location for the hub cache
# ~/.cache/huggingface/hub to this location

# This script starts singularity with all the expected binds in place.
# The following binds / overlays are defined

# --containall --no-home Ensures that the container is well isolated
# -B $HOME/.ssh: binds the ssh directory to ensure that ssh authorized keys are propagated
# -B /scratch: binds the entire /scratch filesystem
# -B $PWD: binds the current working directory
# --nv: enables CUDA integration for the container to pass-through GPUs
# --overlay overlay-base.ext3: overlay with the base packages, created by scripts/create_base_overlay.sh
# --overlay overlay-packages.ext3: overlay with our installed packages, created by scripts/create_package_overlay.sh
